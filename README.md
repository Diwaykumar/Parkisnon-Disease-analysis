This project uses machine learning techniques to present an analysis of Parkinson's disease.  
Dataset to analyze  disease is loaded with such data , which includes a variety of 
voicerelated characteristics from people with and without Parkinson's disease. Following 
preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, the dataset is divided into training and testing 
sets. Based on the chosen features, five distinct machine learning models—Logistic 
Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random 
Forest—are used to predict the disease status.
